## About the Project

This project is created to expand my knowledge in React and Next JS, and how to structure a mid-level complexity web application. It is a movie database where you can view the information of a specific movie or tv show. It is mainly inspired by [Netflix's](https://www.netflix.com) design. I've also inserted a really close clone of Netflix's original splash animation (forked from a famous [Codepen from Claudio Bonfati](https://codepen.io/claudio_bonfati)), made entirely with CSS, paired with [Netflix's starting sound.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV3HUDMQ-F8) It took me months in making the project while also focusing on my college studies. As much as possible, I've tried to maintain this project, updating whenever a certain package has an update, as well as adding minor features, bug fixes and performance improvements.
